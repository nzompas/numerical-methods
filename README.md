# ðŸ“Š Numerical Methods - Root Finding & Integration Methods

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **numerical analysis** methods, including root-finding techniques and numerical integration methods.

## ðŸ§® Implemented Methods
### ðŸ”¹ Root-Finding Methods
1. **Bisection Method** (Bisection.py)
2. **Newton-Raphson Method** (Newton-Raphson.py)
3. **Secant Method** (Secand.py)

### ðŸ”¹ Numerical Integration Methods
4. **Simpson's Rule** (Simpson.py)
5. **Trapezoidal Rule** (Trapezoidal.py)

## ðŸ“Œ Description
- **Bisection Method**: A bracketing method that iteratively divides an interval in half to approximate the root of a function.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: Uses tangents to find successively better approximations of a root.
- **Secant Method**: A root-finding method similar to Newton-Raphson but without requiring the derivative.
- **Simpson's Rule**: A numerical integration method that approximates the integral using parabolic segments.
- **Trapezoidal Rule**: Approximates the integral by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids.
